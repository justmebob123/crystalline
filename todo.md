- [x] OBJECTIVE 16 Phase 2: File Organization
- [x] All 13 A-Series Objectives (2A-9A)

## Current Focus: OBJECTIVE 14 - Comprehensive Repository Validation

This is CRITICAL before enabling optimizations. Must validate training and inference work correctly.

### Phase 1: Build System Validation ✅
- [x] Verify all libraries build successfully (9 libraries: 4 .so + 4 .a + docproc)
- [x] Verify all tools build successfully (8 tools built)
- [x] Verify all tests build successfully (25 test executables)
- [x] Check for any missing dependencies (none found)
- [x] Verify clean build (make clean && make) - SUCCESS
- [x] Build warnings: 3 (cosmetic only - format truncation)
- [x] Build errors: 0 ✅

### Phase 2: Runtime Testing ✅
- [x] Test basic application startup (hyper_prime_spiral --help works)
- [x] Test command-line tools (train_model, cllm_crawler, web_scraper all respond)
- [x] Test unit tests (test_softmax_backward: 5/5 PASS, test_attention_cache: 4/4 PASS)
- [x] Verify library loading (LD_LIBRARY_PATH works correctly)
- [x] Basic runtime validation complete

### Phase 3: Training Validation (CRITICAL) - BUG FOUND 🔴
- [x] Test command-line training (tools/train_model) - INFINITE LOOP BUG DISCOVERED
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Fix infinite loop in epoch training
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Test UI training tab (after fix)
- [x] Verify kissing spheres threading works (✅ 63 threads, 157 spheres created)
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Verify checkpoints are created (training never completes)
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Verify loss decreases over epochs (stuck in infinite loop)
- [x] Test with small dataset first (320 tokens, 1 batch)
- [x] Monitor for crashes or hangs (HANGS - infinite loop after first batch)

**CRITICAL BUG**: Epoch loop never terminates. Processes 26,000+ batch groups when only 1 batch exists.
- First batch: loss = 0.0778 ✅
- Subsequent batches: loss = 0.0000 (no data)
- Loop never exits, never saves model
- See: PHASE3_TRAINING_CRITICAL_BUG_FOUND.md

### Phase 4: Inference Validation (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Test command-line inference
- [ ] Test UI LLM tab inference
- [ ] Verify model loading works
- [ ] Verify text generation works
- [ ] Test with trained checkpoint

### Phase 5: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test crawler integration
- [ ] Test web scraper
- [ ] Test PDF processing tools
- [ ] Test vocabulary building

### Phase 6: Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] Measure training speed (tokens/sec)
- [ ] Measure inference speed (tokens/sec)
- [ ] Verify 64-thread utilization
- [ ] Compare with expected performance

### Phase 7: Memory and Resource Testing
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during training
- [ ] Check for memory leaks
- [ ] Verify resource cleanup
- [ ] Test with larger datasets

### Phase 8: Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with invalid inputs
- [ ] Test with missing files
- [ ] Test with corrupted data
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear

### Phase 9: Documentation Validation
- [ ] Verify README is accurate
- [ ] Check all documentation files
- [ ] Verify examples work

### Phase 10: Final Verification
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No crashes or hangs
- [ ] Performance meets expectations
- [ ] Ready for optimization (-O3)

## Remaining High Priority
- [ ] OBJECTIVE 15: Comprehensive UI and CLI Analysis

## Remaining Low Priority
- [ ] OBJECTIVE 13: Documentation and Testing

## Notes
- Keeping debug mode (-O0) until Phases 3 & 4 complete
- Will enable -O3 optimization AFTER training/inference validated
- Expected 2-10x speedup once optimization enabled
