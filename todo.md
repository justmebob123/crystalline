# TODO: OBJECTIVES 2 & 12 - COMPLETE ✅

## Session Summary

### OBJECTIVE 2: Fix Training Pipeline ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE

**All Tasks Verified**:
- [x] Identify OLD vs NEW training functions
- [x] Map function call chains
- [x] Identify fallback paths
- [x] Analyze legacy files (all already deleted)
- [x] Remove fallbacks (none exist)
- [x] Delete redundant files (already deleted)
- [x] Update Makefile (already updated)
- [x] Fix broken include in train_model.c

**Result**: Training pipeline uses pure kissing spheres architecture with crystalline GCD optimizations.
