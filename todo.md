# TODO - CRYSTALLINE CLLM PROJECT

---

## 🔒 MANDATORY RULES (PASTE AT TOP OF EVERY RESPONSE)

### ⭐ RULE 0: ALWAYS PASTE RULES TO TOP OF TODO.MD WITH EVERY RESPONSE ⭐
**HIGHEST PRIORITY RULE - MUST BE FOLLOWED WITH EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE**

At the beginning of EVERY response, you MUST:
1. Paste these rules to the top of todo.md
2. Read the MASTER_PLAN.md completely
3. Read the AUDIT.md for current architectural state
4. Read the SECONDARY_OBJECTIVES.md for detailed tasks

This creates a permanent loop ensuring rules are never forgotten.

### RULE 1: ALWAYS REREAD MASTER_PLAN.MD BEFORE ANY ACTION
**SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY RULE**

Before taking ANY action, you MUST:
1. Read MASTER_PLAN.md completely
2. Understand the current objectives
3. Verify your action aligns with the master plan
4. Check for any blocking priorities

This ensures all work follows the architectural design.

### RULE 2: NO MATH.H ANYWHERE IN PRODUCTION CODE
**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENT**

- ❌ NO `#include <math.h>` in any production code
- ✅ ONLY use crystalline math functions (prime_*)
- ✅ Test files MAY use math.h for verification
- ✅ All math operations use crystalline library

### RULE 3: REMOVE REDUNDANT CODE IMMEDIATELY
**EFFICIENCY AND DESIGN REQUIREMENT**

When moving or refactoring code:
1. Verify old implementation is no longer used
2. Delete old files immediately after verification
3. Ensure NO duplication or redundancy
4. Merge similar functions for maximum efficiency
5. Use proper naming conventions
6. Update all references

### RULE 4: COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION AND MERGES
**QUALITY REQUIREMENT**

When moving functionality between layers:
1. Complete full implementation in new location
2. Merge similar functions to avoid duplication
3. Ensure proper naming conventions
4. Verify all references updated
5. Delete old code after verification
6. Test build after changes

### RULE 5: MAKE PRACTICAL DECISIONS
**AUTONOMY REQUIREMENT**

- Make decisions based on practical application and relevance
- Don't ask for approval on obvious architectural decisions
- Remove redundant code when it's clearly not needed
- Trust the architectural principles and proceed

### RULE 7: FIX ALL BUILD WARNINGS BEFORE PROCEEDING
**QUALITY REQUIREMENT**

- Build with -Wall -Wextra flags enabled
- Address ALL warnings, not just errors
- Zero warnings required before proceeding
