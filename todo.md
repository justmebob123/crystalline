# TODO: Deep Mathematical Analysis and Sieve Verification

## Current Task
Deeply examine the mathematics library and sieve implementation to ensure correct representation of the crystalline lattice abacus.

## Phase 1: Understanding the Mathematical Framework [COMPLETE]
- [x] Clone repository
- [x] Read and analyze MASTER_PLAN.md
- [x] Study all mathematical framework images in docs/mathematical_framework/
- [x] Review the mathematical documentation and research papers
- [x] Understand the crystalline lattice abacus concept
- [x] Understand the kissing spheres geometry
- [x] Understand the rainbow table implementation

## Phase 2: Code Analysis [COMPLETE]
- [x] Locate and examine the current sieve implementation
- [x] Review the mathematics library structure
- [x] Identify where the sieve was added/modified
- [x] Compare implementation against mathematical framework
- [x] Check for efficiency issues
- [x] **CRITICAL FINDING**: No traditional sieve exists - this is CORRECT!

## Phase 3: Verification and Correction [COMPLETE]
- [x] Verify sieve correctly represents crystalline lattice abacus
- [x] Verify sieve correctly represents kissing spheres
- [x] Verify rainbow table integration
- [x] Verify prime generation algorithm
- [x] Make necessary corrections if implementation is incorrect
- [x] Document findings and changes
- [x] **VERIFIED**: All implementations are correct and faithful to the mathematical framework!

## Phase 4: Final Review [IN PROGRESS]
- [x] Test corrected implementation
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Commit and push changes
- [ ] Report findings to user
