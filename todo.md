# TODO: Resume Work on Codebase Following MASTER_PLAN

## Master Plan Improvements Complete ✅
- [x] Updated RULE 3 with prominent READ-ONLY warnings
- [x] User decision: Skip success criteria, focus on actual work

## Current State Analysis

### Completed Objectives (A-Series): 13/13 ✅
1. OBJECTIVE 1: Library Distribution Architecture ✅
2. OBJECTIVE 2A: Integrate Crystalline GCD Optimizations ✅
3. OBJECTIVE 2B: Remove ALL Legacy Loss Functions ✅
4. OBJECTIVE 2C: Rename "Crystalline" to Default ✅
5. OBJECTIVE 2D: Remove ALL "Standard" and "Legacy" Code ✅
6. OBJECTIVE 3A: Crystalline Math Everywhere ✅
7. OBJECTIVE 4A: Static Libraries as Primary ✅
8. OBJECTIVE 5A: Kissing Spheres as ONLY Threading ✅
9. OBJECTIVE 6A: Infinite Recursive Self-Similar 12-Fold Symmetry ✅
10. OBJECTIVE 7A: Recursive Control Threads (all 4 phases) ✅
11. OBJECTIVE 8A: Remove ALL Conditional Compilation ✅
12. OBJECTIVE 9A: Integrate Recursive Spheres with Threading ✅

### Completed Original Objectives: 5/13 ✅
- OBJECTIVE 3: Kissing Spheres UI Integration ✅
- OBJECTIVE 4: LLM Tab Integration ✅
- OBJECTIVE 6: SIMD Integration ✅
- OBJECTIVE 7: 12-Fold Symmetry Implementation ✅
- OBJECTIVE 8: Node Zero (Control Thread) ✅

### In Progress: 1/2
- OBJECTIVE 16: Technical Debt Cleanup (Phase 1 complete)

### Remaining Original Objectives: 8/13
- OBJECTIVE 2: Fix Training Pipeline (partially analyzed)
- OBJECTIVE 5: Verify Crystalline Math Integration
- OBJECTIVE 9: Verify Recursive Sphere Geometry
- OBJECTIVE 10: Verify Infrastructure Integration
- OBJECTIVE 11: Optimize Performance Bottlenecks
- OBJECTIVE 12: Complete Tool Integration
- OBJECTIVE 13: Documentation and Testing
- OBJECTIVE 14: Comprehensive Repository Validation

### Remaining New Objectives: 1/2
- OBJECTIVE 15: Comprehensive UI and CLI Analysis

## Next Objective Selection

Based on priority and dependencies, the logical next steps are:

**Option 1: Complete OBJECTIVE 16 (Technical Debt)**
- Phase 1 complete (broken files deleted)
- Phase 2: File organization
- Phase 3: Address TODO comments
- Quick wins, cleans up codebase

**Option 2: OBJECTIVE 2 (Fix Training Pipeline)**
- CRITICAL priority
- Partially analyzed
- Blocks other objectives
- Core functionality

**Option 3: OBJECTIVE 12 (Complete Tool Integration)**
- HIGH priority
- Ensures all CLI tools work
- User-facing functionality

## Recommendation
Start with **OBJECTIVE 16 Phase 2** (file organization) - quick cleanup that makes other work easier.

Then move to **OBJECTIVE 2** (training pipeline) - critical core functionality.
