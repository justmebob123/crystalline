The sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering.
Light from the sun contains all colors of the rainbow.
Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.
When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with air molecules.
These collisions scatter blue light in all directions.
This is why we see a blue sky during the day.
At sunset, light travels through more atmosphere.
More blue light gets scattered away, leaving red and orange.
This creates beautiful sunset colors.
The ocean appears blue for similar reasons.
Water absorbs red light more than blue light.
Deep water looks darker blue because less light reaches it.
Prime numbers are fundamental in mathematics.
A prime number is only divisible by one and itself.
The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
There are infinitely many prime numbers.
This was proven by Euclid over 2000 years ago.
Prime numbers are used in cryptography.
RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of factoring large primes.
The Riemann Hypothesis concerns the distribution of primes.
