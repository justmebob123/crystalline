Mathematics forms the foundation of science and engineering. Algebra deals with symbols and rules for manipulating them. Calculus studies continuous change and motion.

Geometry explores shapes, sizes, and spatial relationships. Euclidean geometry describes flat spaces with parallel lines. Non-Euclidean geometries model curved spaces.

Statistics analyzes data to draw conclusions and make predictions. Probability theory quantifies uncertainty and randomness. Hypothesis testing evaluates claims about populations.

Number theory investigates properties of integers and primes. Prime numbers are fundamental building blocks in mathematics. Cryptography relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

Linear algebra studies vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It provides tools for solving systems of equations. Applications span computer graphics, machine learning, and physics.

Discrete mathematics deals with countable objects and structures. Graph theory models networks and relationships. Combinatorics counts arrangements and selections.

Mathematical proofs establish truth through logical reasoning. Induction proves statements for all natural numbers. Contradiction assumes the opposite and derives impossibility.

Applied mathematics solves real-world problems using mathematical methods. Optimization finds best solutions under constraints. Numerical analysis approximates solutions computationally.
